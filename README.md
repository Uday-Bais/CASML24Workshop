# CASML24Workshop
Material for the preconference workshop on Scientific Machine Learning at the International Conference on Applied AI and Scientific Machine Learning (CASML) 2024

## PINNs_workshop

This folder contains resources for the **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** workshop. It includes two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different aspects of solving forward and inverse problems using PINNs.

- [Forward Problem Notebook](PINNs_workshop/forward_problem.ipynb)  
  This notebook demonstrates the solution of a forward problem using PINNs, focusing on the application of neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
  
- [Inverse Problem Notebook](PINNs_workshop/inverse_problem.ipynb)  
  This notebook explores the solution of an inverse problem using PINNs, where the goal is to infer unknown parameters or functions from data.

## vPINNs_workshop

This folder contains resources for the **Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (vPINNs)** workshop. The vPINNs approach extends the traditional PINNs framework by incorporating variational principles to improve the accuracy and efficiency of solving PDEs and inverse problems.

- More details and resources for this workshop will be available here.
